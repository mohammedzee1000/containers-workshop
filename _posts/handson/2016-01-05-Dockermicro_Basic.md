There is a big race to see who can dominate the cloud market. And guess what, none of the traditional operating systems is going to win.

The reason for this is because they are too big, too bloated. How many can say they have used every feature of your operating systems? How many curse the designer of the operating system for unnecessary software just thrown at them. 

The thing is the cloud is no place for the fat and heavy weight champions. You need lean, mean killing machines to survive.  As a result, a new breed of super-skinny, minimalist operating systems is emerging to replace the traditional operating systems. 

**We’re going to refer to these minimalist operating systems as micro operating systems**. Sometimes, they are also referred to as container operating systems, as they are designed to run containers. 
To set the scene, the cloud is about three major things – density, elasticity, and security. Obviously the cloud is about lots of things, but density, elasticity, and security are at the center of cloud computing. 

And it’s these three factors that are heralding the death of the traditional operating system in the cloud, and the birth of the micro operating system.

##So what is a Micro OS?
**In a nutshell, a micro operating system is an operating system designed for one thing, and one thing only -- server workloads**. No extra stuff, no bloat ware. In fact there is no GUI, no desktop productivity application, not even server services unless absolutely necessary. 

**A core tenet of the micro OS is that smaller footprints enable greater densities and greater security**. Or put another way, smaller footprints lead to less complexity, fewer vulnerabilities, less patching, fewer reboots, shorter boot times... in short, less waste. 

And while this all started out in the Linux world, the battle is so hot that it has spilled over into the Windows world. Everyone is vying to be crowned king of the cloud.
